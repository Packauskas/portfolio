  <h1>Research</h1>
  <h2>Interests</h2>
  <p>
    I am interested in homological algebra and its applications to commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.  My doctoral research concerns the growth of Betti sequences of finitely generated modules over local complete intersection rings.  I am currently focused on developing other applications of the homotopy Lie algebra in local algebras.  My doctoral advisors were Luchezar Avramov and Mark Walker at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.
