<h1> Spring 2020 </h1>
This semester was unprecedent, as in-person classes were suspended after spring break due to COVID-19.   <a href="teaching/s20reflection.pdf"> A reflection on my experiences this semester is available here. </a>
<h2> MAT 272: Linear Algebra </h2>
I taught two sections of linear algebra this semester. Some of the materials from the previous semester were minorly tweaked. I present materials below that are either brand new or heavily edited from the previous semester.
In addition to the materials listed below, students also had weekly assignments on Pearson's MyMathLab as well as in-class vocabularly quizzes which I referred to as "Definition and Theorem Checks."<br><br>
<a href="teaching/mat272s20/syllabus.pdf"> Syllabus </a> - Course Syllabus<br><br>
<a href="teaching/mat272s20/samplenotes.pdf"> Sample of Guided Notes </a> - I provided approximately 110 pages of guided notes throughout the semester for the students to complete in class.<br><br>
<a href="teaching/mat272s20/samplehw.pdf"> Guided Notes </a> - I made the written homework slightly longer and focused on technical writing and explanation. <br><br>
<a href="teaching/mat272s20/samplerr.pdf"> Sample Reading Reflection </a> - I assigned "Reading Reflections"; the students would read a section of the textbook beforen class and answered questions about it through Blackboard.<br><br>
After the shutdown, I recorded lectures, uploaded them to Youtube, and made them available to the students.  <a href="https://youtu.be/GHdT8unUlZAHere"> Here </a> is a sample video. I kept up with the <a href="teaching/mat272s20/samplews.pdf">guided notes,</a> but expanded the number of practice problems at the end of each section, then made solutions available for students. Homework and exams switched to solely online through MyMathLab. <br><br>

 <h1> Fall 2020 </h1>
I taught MAT 115 and 370 this semsester. Both of my classes this semester started in a hybrid format but were swithced to distance learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic. <a href="teaching/f20r.pdf">  A reflection on my experiences this semester is available here. </a>

<h2>  MAT 115: Precalculus </h2>
I taught two sections of precalculus this semester, and it was my first semester teaching this class at Cortland. The class started as partially asynchronous with in-person discussion sections and then transitioned to fully synchronous lectures. In addition to the materials below, I assigned weekly assignments through MyMathLab. <br><br>
<a href="teaching/mat115f20/syllabus.pdf"> Syllabus </a> - Course Syllabus<br><br>
During the first part of the course, I posted videos for those not attending in person to watch and complete worksheets before theri f2f day that week.  <a href="https://youtu.be/-YFzi6CHzI0"> A sample video is available here </a>, and <a href="teaching/mat115f20/sampleonline.pdf"> a sample corresponding worksheet is available here.</a> On the day they came to class, we would work through a more advanced worksheet on the week's material.  <a href="teaching/mat115f20/samplews.pdf"> A sample of such a worksheet is available here. </a><br><br>
I decided that this format wasn't working well as I would like, so I switched to a more traditional lecture and always posted my notes.  <a href="teaching/mat115f20/samplenotes.pdf">Here's a sample of what the notes looked like.</a><br><br>
<a href="teaching/mat115f20/samplewa.pdf"> Sample Written Assignment </a>-- Throughout the course, there was written homework due most weeks for a total of 12 assignments.   <br><br>
<a href="teaching/mat115f20/sampleexam.pdf"> Sample Exam </a> -- The course had three midterm exams and an online final.  I wrote three different versions of each exam as only 1/3 of the class could attend each day in person.  <br><br>

<h2> MAT 370: Algebraic Stuctures </h2>
<a href="teaching/mat370f20/syllabus.pdf"> Syllabus </a> - Course Syllabus<br><br>

<a href="teaching/mat370f20/samplenotes.pdf"> Sample of Guided Notes </a> -- I prepared more than 100 pages of guided notes for this class. <br><br>
<a href="teaching/mat370f20/samplehw.pdf"> Sample of Written Assignment </a> -- At the start of the course, I assigned weekly homework.<br><br>
Due to rampant plagiarism, I was forced to change from weekly written homework assignments to quizzes.  I provided them with a list of <a href="teaching/mat370f20/samplepractice.pdf"> practice problems </a> and then would post <a href="teaching/mat370f20/samplequiz.pdf"> a quiz similar to those problems </a> on Blackboard.  They would have 30 minutes to complete the quiz once they opened it. <br><br>
<a href="teaching/mat370f20/sampleexam.pdf"> Sample Exam </a> -- There were three midterm exams, and an optional online final in the same format.  I dropped the lowest exam. I had to write two versions of each face-to-face exam as only half of the class could be present on a given day due to distancing. I also provided the class with a practice version of each exam to use to study.<br><br>

 <h1> Spring 2021 </h1>
 This semester, I taught MAT 115, 224, and 370.  All three classes were taught in a hybrid format. <a href="teaching/s21r.pdf"> A reflection on my experiences this semester is available here. </a>
<h2> MAT 115: Precalculus </h2>
This course was taught fairly similarly to the previous semester. Due to synchronous hybrid, class consisted mostly of lecture. <a href="teaching/mat115s21/samplenotes.pdf">Here's a sample of the lecture notes I would post after class.</a>  In addition to the materials below, there was weekly homework due on Pearson's MyMathLab.  <br><br>
<a href="teaching/mat115s21/syllabus.pdf"> Syllabus </a> - Course Syllabus<br><br>
<a href="teaching/mat115s21/samplehw.pdf"> Sample of Written Assignment </a> -- There were a total of 11 written assignments assigned throughout the semester.<br><br>
<a href="teaching/mat115s21/sampleexam.pdf"> Sample Exam </a> -- The course had three midterm exams and a final.  I wrote three different versions of each midterm exam as only 1/3 of the class could attend each day in person. I also provided the class with a practice version of the exam to use to study. <br><br>
Because only 1/3 of the class could attend in person, each exam would take up an entire week of class.  To make up for lost time, I would post online activities to do during these weeks. I would record <a href="https://youtu.be/NFkW522wLvQ"> a video over certain material </a> and have them <a href="teaching/mat115s21/sampleonline.pdf"> complete a worksheet </a> for a participation grade. <br><br>

<h2> MAT 224: Proofs and Reasoning</h2>
This was my first time teaching this course, so I developed all new materials for it. Due to its synchronous hybrid style, class largely consisted of lecture. <a href="teaching/224s21/samplenotes.pdf"> Here is an example of the notes I would post after each lecture. </a><br><br>
<a href="teaching/224s21/syllabus.pdf"> Syllabus </a> - Course Syllabus<br><br>
<a href="teaching/224s21/samplehw.pdf"> Sample Homework </a> -- There were a total of 11 written assignements during the semester.  I provided detailed feedback on these and returned them to the students. <br><br>
<a href="teaching/224s21/samplexam.pdf"> Sample Exam </a> -- There were three midterm exams and a final exam. I wrote three different versions of each midterm exam as only 1/3 of the class could attend each day in person.  I also provided the class with a practice version of each exam to use to study. <br><br>
Because only 1/3 of the class could attend in person, each exam would take up an entire week of class.  To make up for lost time, I would post online activities to do during these weeks. I would link to a video over certain material (GVSU has videos over each section in the book on Youtube) </a> and have them <a href="teaching/224s21/sampleonline.pdf"> complete a worksheet </a> for a participation grade. <br><br>

<h2> MAT 370: Algebraic Stuctures </h2>
  This was my third semester in a row teaching this course.  There are many similarities to previous semesters with a few updates. For examples of written assignments and exams, see the previous semester as they were very similar. <br><br>
<a href="teaching/370s21/syllabus.pdf"> Syllabus </a> - Course Syllabus<br><br>
  <a href="teaching/370s21/lecturenotes.pdf"> Guided Lecture Notes </a> -- I updated and added to my previous guided lecture notes.  I have now compiled them in one document that is 150+ pages long and features some practice problems.<br><br>
  <a href="teaching/370s21/samplews.pdf"> Sample In-class Activity </a> -- I was able to implement in-clas work this semester, though infrequently.<br><br>
  One of the final assessments for this class was a Proof Portfolio. <a href="teaching/370s21/portfolio.pdf"> Here are the instructions </a> that I gave for completing the portfolio and <a href="teaching/370s21/sampleportfolio.pdf"> here is an example </a> of one of the student's finished portfolios. <br><br>

 <h1> Fall 2021 </h1>
 I taught MAT 115 and 272 this fall.  We were able to return to face-to-face instruction this semester. <a href="teaching/f21r.pdf">A reflection on my experiences this semester is available here. </a>
<h2> MAT 115: Precalculus </h2>
This was my third semester in a row teaching this class, however this time I radically changed the format of the class to a standards based grading (sometimes called Mastery Grading) system.  Final grades were assigned according to a bundle system. A typical day in class consisted of a short lecture followed by a worksheet. The notes and solutions to the worksheet would be posted to blackboard after class.

A stuent could retake any quiz two more times during office hours if necessary.  There were no traditional midterm exams, but there were "quiz days" which would feature multiple quizzes graded individually. <br><br>
