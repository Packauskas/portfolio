Here you can find information about my teaching record at SUNY Cortland.  I have included samples of materials developed and raw CTE data and student comments for each course. <a href="teaching/ctesummary.pdf">A brief summary of my CTE scores is available here.</a>
<h1> Fall 2019 </h1>
 This was my first semester at SUNY Cortland. <a href="teaching/f19r.pdf">A reflection on my experiences this semester is available here. </a>

<h2> MAT 121: Calculus A </h2>
Below are the materials I developed for Calculus A.  In addition to the materials sampled below, students also completed weekly assignments online through Pearson's MyMathLab. <br><br>
<a href="teaching/mat121f19/syllabus.pdf"> Syllabus </a> - Course Syllabus<br><br>
<a href="teaching/mat121f19/sampleworksheet.pdf"> Sample In-Class Activity </a> - Every day in class students would work through problems in groups.<br><br>
<a href="teaching/mat121f19/samplewrittenhw.pdf"> Sample Written Assignment </a> - Students would turn in weekly written assignments for feedback on writing, accuracy, and organization. <br><br>
<a href="teaching/mat121f19/sampleexam.pdf"> Sample Exam </a> - There were three midterm exams through the course of the semester. <br><br>

<h2> MAT 272: Linear Algebra</h2>
I taught two sections of linear algebra this semester. In addition to the materials sampled below, students also completed weekly assignements through Pearson's MyMathLab<br><br>
<a href="teaching/mat272f19/syllabus.pdf"> Syllabus </a> - Course Syllabus<br><br>
<a href="teaching/mat272f19/samplews.pdf"> Sample In-Class Activity </a> - When time permitted, the class would work through problems in small groups.<br><br>
<a href="teaching/mat272f19/samplehw.pdf"> Sample Written Homework </a>  - Weekly written assignments were collected and feedback was given on accuracy and technical writing skills. <br><br>
<a href="teaching/mat272f19/sampleexam.pdf"> Sample Exam </a> - There were three midterm exams throughout the semester.<br><br>
<a href="teaching/mat272f19/letter.pdf"> Observation Letter </a> - My classroom was observed by Dr. Jolie Roat once during this semester. <br><br>

<h1> Spring 2020 </h1>
This semester was unprecedent, as in-person classes were suspended after spring break due to COVID-19.   <a href="teaching/s20reflection.pdf"> A reflection on my experiences this semester is available here. </a>
<h2> MAT 272: Linear Algebra </h2>
I taught two sections of linear algebra this semester. Some of the materials from the previous semester were minorly tweaked. I present materials below that are either brand new or heavily edited from the previous semester.
In addition tot he materials listed below, students also had weekly assignments on Pearson's MyMathLab as well as in-class vocabularly quizzes which I referred to as "Definition and Theorem Checks."<br><br>
<a href="teaching/mat272s20/syllabus.pdf"> Syllabus </a> - Course Syllabus<br><br>
<a href="teaching/mat272s20/samplenotes.pdf"> Sample of Guided Notes </a> - I provided approximately 110 pages of guided notes throughout the semester for the students to complete in class.<br><br>
<a href="teaching/mat272s20/samplehw.pdf"> Guided Notes </a> - I made the written homework slightly longer and focused on technical writing and explanation. <br><br>
<a href="teaching/mat272s20/samplerr.pdf"> Sample Reading Reflection </a> - I assigned "Reading Reflections"; the students would read a section of the textbook beforen class and answered questions about it through Blackboard.<br><br>
After the shutdown, I recorded lectures, uploaded them to Youtube, and made them available to the students.  <a href="https://youtu.be/GHdT8unUlZAHere"> Here </a> is a sample video. I kept up with the <a href="teaching/mat272s20/samplews.pdf">guided notes </a>, but expanded the number of practice problems at the end of each section, then made solutions available for students. Homework and exams switched to solely online through MyMathLab. <br><br>

<h2> MAT 370: Algebraic Structures I </h2>
<a href="teaching/mat370s20/syllabus.pdf"> Syllabus </a> - Course Syllabus<br><br>
<a href="teaching/mat370s20/samplews.pdf"> Sample In-Class Activity </a> - A handful of times throughout the semester, the class would work through problems in small groups.<br><br>
<a href="teaching/mat370s20/samplehw.pdf"> Sample Written Homework </a>  - Weekly written assignments were collected and feedback was given on accuracy and technical writing skills. <br><br>
<a href="teaching/mat370s20/sampleexam.pdf"> Sample Exam </a> - There were three midterm exams throughout the semester.<br><br>
After the shutdown, I recorded lectures, uploaded them to Youtube, and made them available to the students.  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Rs8DGyLkhw"> Here</a> is a sample video.  The videos were always accompanied by a <a href="teaching/mat370s20/samplews2.pdf">worksheet</a> for which I would provide solutions. <br><br>
