%% The following tells LaTeX that we are using the

\documentclass{amsart}

%% This has a default type size 10pt.  Other options are 11pt and 12pt
%% This are set by replacing the command above by

%% Some mathematical symbols are not included in the basic LaTeX

\usepackage{amssymb}

%% The following is commands are used for importing various types of
%% grapics.
%% 
\usepackage{tikz-cd}
%\usepackage{epsfig}  		% For postscript
%\usepackage{epic,eepic}       % For epic and eepic output from xfig

%% The following is very useful in keeping track of labels while

%%%% The next few commands set up the theorem type environments.

\newtheorem{thm}{Theorem}[section]
\newtheorem{prop}[thm]{Proposition}
\newtheorem{lem}[thm]{Lemma}
\newtheorem{cor}[thm]{Corollary}
\newtheorem{conj}[thm]{Conjecture}

%%
%% If some other type is need, say conjectures, then it is constructed

%%% 
%%% The following gives definition type environments (which only differ

\theoremstyle{definition}
\newtheorem{definition}[thm]{Definition}
\newtheorem{example}[thm]{Example}

%% Again more of these can be added by uncommenting and editing the

\theoremstyle{remark}

\newtheorem{remark}[thm]{Remark}


%%%
%%% The following, if uncommented, numbers equations within sections.

%%% The following show how to make definition (also called macros or

\title{Higher Differentials over Graded Commutative Rings}
\author{R. Diethorn, J. Jeffries, C. Miller, N. Packauskas, J. Pollitz, H. Rahmati, S. Vassiliadou }


\begin{abstract}
	The goal of this project is to describe modules of higher differentials for graded algebras over a field.  We have developed several methods of describing a computable free resolution of its dual, the module of principal parts. 
\end{abstract}


\maketitle

This project is ongoing work beginning March 2019. We currently have some preliminary results in special cases and some computations on Macaulay2 (an algebra computing system) . We would like to describe the free resolution of the module of principal parts $P^n_{R/k}$ over a graded commutative ring $R$.  So far, we have only been successful if the defining elements of $R$ have low degree.  This is joint work with Rachel Diethorn (Yale University), Jack Jeffries (University of Nebraska-Lincoln), Claudia Miller (Syracuse University), Josh Pollitz (University of Utah), Hamid Rahmati (University of Nebraska-Lincoln) and Sophia Vassiliadou (Georgetown University). We hope to have publishable results in the next year.
